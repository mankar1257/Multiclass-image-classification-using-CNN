# MultiClass-Image-Classification-using-CNN
To classify  image data CNN models are used (Mostly) 

Problem statement : 
            given a image data ,the task is to classify the image according to the six different category 
            
Data set : 
            This Data-set contains around 25k images of size 150x150 distributed under 6 categories. {'buildings' -> 0, 'forest' -> 1, 'glacier' -> 2, 'mountain' -> 3, 'sea' -> 4, 'street' -> 5 }

  The Train, Test and Prediction data is separated in each zip files. There are around 14k images in Train, 3k in Test and 7k in Prediction. This data was initially published on https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com by Intel to host a Image classification Challenge.
  
  You can download the dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/puneet6060/intel-image-classification 
  
  I have developed CNN model which can classify the image in to six different classes according to the problem statement .
